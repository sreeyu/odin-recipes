    <img src="../images/sandwich.jpg" alt="">
    <p>
        In our house, we love eating this healthy veg
        mayo sandwich for breakfast or evening snacks.
        It is quick and easy to make, loaded with
        fresh vegetables and mayo. These sandwiches can
        be eaten cold or grilled.
