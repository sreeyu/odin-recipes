    <p>
        There is nothing simpler than a good bowl of
        kanji, a traditional food of a malayali. It is 
        light in texture, but it has energy-boosting elements
        that give you the strength to face the day. It is 
        perfect for reviving a tired body after a long
        working day.
    </p>
    <p>So, let's get started right away.</p>
    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Par-boiled rice - 1/2 Cup</li>
        <li>Water - 5-6 Cups</li>
        <li>Salt - to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Wash the rice for at least 3 times.
        </li>
        <li>
            Boil the water in a pressure cooker. When
            the water starts to boil, gradually add the 
            rice along with a dash of salt into it.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the pressure cooker with the lid
            and cook on a high flame for 3-4 whistels.
        </li>
        <li>
            Switch off the flame and wait for the pressure
            to release.
        </li>
        <li>
            remove the lid and stir the kanji with a ladle.
        </li>
        <li>
            Adjust the consistency to suit your preference.
        </li>
    </ol>
